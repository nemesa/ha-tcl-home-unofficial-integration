TCL Home home assistant integration (unofficial)


## Credit:
The idea how to do basic login is from [DavidIlie's proejct ](https://github.com/DavidIlie/tcl-home-ac)

This Home Assistant integration [samples](https://github.com/msp1974/HAIntegrationExamples) helped a lot.

## How it's work

This integration is the result of a reverse enginering of the "TCL Home" andoid app.
For setup we only need the user/pass which is used for the app.
(as this is not offical integration from TCL I would recomend to create a new user for this integration and share your devices to that use, in case of TCL decide to ban the user)

## How to install
WIP
